Stadium Southland and Statium Southland Velodrome are at the same location, but actually
two separate facilities. The velodrome was used as a temporary facility while the original was 
being repaired.

Adelaide Arena and Entertainment Centre and DIFFERENT.

Loss of the time variable is unfortunate. What I would have liked to have done is that I might 
compare how performance is better during the day or during the night. Even so, it's still missing a year.
